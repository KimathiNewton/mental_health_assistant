## Project Overview: Mental Health Assistant RAG
This project, Mental Health Assistant RAG, was developed to support individuals with mental health concerns by implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The assistant intelligently answers mental health-related queries by integrating a knowledge base and large language models (LLMs). The system is designed to assist with questions about issues such as depression, trauma, stress, grief, and relationships. By leveraging retrieval and generation capabilities, this project offers users accurate, supportive, and personalized responses, making it a valuable tool for mental health guidance and education.

## üß† Problem Description
Mental health is a crucial aspect of well-being, affecting millions of people worldwide. However, individuals seeking guidance often face challenges in finding trustworthy, relevant, and personalized information quickly. The complexity and sensitivity of mental health issues, coupled with the vast amount of available resources, make it difficult for people to get timely, accurate advice.

This project aims to address these challenges by developing an intelligent mental health assistant that can handle complex queries and provide contextually relevant and accurate answers. By leveraging RAG techniques, the system combines the reasoning power of LLMs with the precision of curated mental health knowledge, ensuring that users receive personalized support and guidance based on expert sources. This assistant makes mental health resources more accessible and helps reduce the stigma associated with seeking help, offering a bridge between individuals and the mental health care they need.
